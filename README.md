# YunoJuno Bugs and Issues (UK)

This is a public repository used to raise bugs and issues found on the live YunoJuno platform.

Issues can be reviewed & raised here - https://github.com/yunojuno/issues-uk/issues

If you find a bug, please raise it here, using the following format:

1. What were you attempting to do?
2. What did you expect would happen?
3. What actually happened?

Please include as much detail as possible - bear in mind that the developer tasked with fixing the issue will need to replicate it before they can find out what is wrong - so they will need to know what page you were on, what button you pressed / link you clicked, what device you were on etc.

1. Device - desktop / tablet / phone
2. OS - Windows / Mac
3. URL of page you were on / link you clicked
4. Freelancer or Employer

Please add screenshots - or write another 1,000 words.
