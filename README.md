# YunoJuno Bugs and Issues (UK)

This is a public repository used to raise bugs and issues found on the live YunoJuno platform.

Issues can be reviewed & raised here - https://github.com/yunojuno/issues-uk/issues

If you find a bug, please raise it here, using the following format:

1. What were you attempting to do?
2. What did you expect would happen?
3. What actually happened?

Please include as much detail as possible - bear in mind that the developer tasked with fixing the issue will need to replicate it before they can find out what is wrong - so they will need to know what page you were on, what button you pressed / link you clicked, what device you were on etc.

1. Device - desktop / tablet / phone
2. OS - Windows / Mac / Linux
3. Browser you are using (Tip: using http://supportdetails.com/ makes it easy to capture full details)
4. URL of page you were on / the link you clicked
5. Whether it affects a Freelancer, an Employer or Backoffice 

NB: this is a publicly readable list, so please do not disclose YJ user information here (names, emails, booking details, fees etc - those can be passed directly to the developer who picks up the card)

Please add screenshots - or write another 1,000 words.
